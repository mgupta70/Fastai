In this repo I am reproducing the results of all Fastai lectures Part-1.
There will also be an additional .ipynb with 'H' in filename (like 104H, 305H, etc.) denoting my attempt to reproduce the notebook on a completely different dataset and with custom functions created by me and with various debugging strategies.
