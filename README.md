**Master_Notebooks** directory has 'Master' python notebooks to create Neural Networks for specific tasks like image classification, object detection, collaborative filtering, Tabular data handling, 3D point cloud classification, etc. **Work in progress!!**

Additionally, This repo also contains the notebooks with **'H'** in their filenames (like 104H, 305H, etc.) denoting my attempt to reproduce the Jeremy's lecture. Since, I wrote them from scratch, it might contain significant breakdown of Jeremy's lecture into even simpler chunks which could be specially helpful for someone who is starting in Fastai.
