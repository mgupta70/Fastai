**Master_Notebooks** directory has 'Master' python notebook to create Neural Network for specific task like image classification, object detection, collaborative filtering, Tabular data handling, 3D point cloud classification, etc. **Work in progress!!**

Additionally, This repo also contains the notebooks with **'H'** in their filename (like 104H, 305H, etc.) denoting my attempt to reproduce the Jeremy's lecture. I tried doing everything on my own. Hence it might contain significant breakdown of Jeremy's lecture into even simpler chunks. Anyone who is starting to learn Fastai, it can be helpful to them.
